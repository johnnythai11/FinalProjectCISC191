Description of the Game:
You are playing as a chicken and your goal is to level up by 
winning fights with NPC chickens. NPC chickens will be from level 1-50. 
They will give exp dependent on the level they are. For example, level 1 NPC 
chicken will give 1 exp and level 50 will give 50 Exp. For you to level up 
from level 1 to 2 you will need to gain 100 exp and then every level after 
that exp will increase by 50 percent of the previous exp bar of the last 
level. As you level up, you will need to find a human to adopt and feed you. 
The human will also boost your attack and defense dependent on the human 
level from 1-5. When you kill the NPC chickens, you will be given a random 
number of bones from 3-6. You will be able to use the bones to buy certain 
items in the store. 
The store will sell 
Armor, Claw from 
wood, bronze, copper, iron, and diamond and
