**Game Description:**
You play as a chicken aiming to level up by winning battles against NPC chickens. NPC chickens range from levels 1-50, and each gives experience (EXP) based on its level (e.g., level 1 NPCs give 1 EXP, level 50 gives 50 EXP). To level up from level 1 to 2, you'll need 100 EXP; each subsequent level requires 50 more EXP than the last. 

As you level up, a human character will assist you, boosting your attack and defense based on their level (1-5). After defeating NPC chickens, youâ€™ll earn a random number of bones (3-6), which you can spend on items in the store.
